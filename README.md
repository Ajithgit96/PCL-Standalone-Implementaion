This project deals with Point cloud processing using standalone Point Cloud Library (PCL). It was performed to do a point cloud processing trial before implementing it in 'PCL-ROS-implementation' project.

Point cloud processing tasks implemented in this project are:

- Statistical outlier removal
- Pass through filtering
- Voxel grid downsampling
- kd tree search
- Planar segmentation to remove ground points
- Euclidian cluster extraction
- 3D object recognition with correspondence grouping
- Range image creation
